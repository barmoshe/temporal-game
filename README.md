## ðŸ§  Project Inspiration

This project was created as part of the Web Dev Challenge, inspired by [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftYmXoH0V5I) where developers had 30 minutes to plan and 4 hours to build a multi-device game using Temporal.

The challenge requirements were:
- Build a game that's played on at least 2 devices
- Use Temporal's workflow tools to manage sending information between devices
